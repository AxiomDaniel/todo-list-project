# todo-list-project

This is a code along from a web development bootcamp.

Learnt about CSS animations, CSS gradients, more use of jQuery.
Pretty nifty tool, but is stateless; it does not save the notes I put up once I refresh the page. I hope when I start learning about backend dev, I'll know what are the steps I should undertake to make this work.
